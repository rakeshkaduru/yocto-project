# What is an Embedded System?

An **embedded system** is a combination of **software and hardware** designed to perform a **specific function or task** within a larger system.

---

## ðŸ”‘ Key Characteristics:

- Contains a **processing unit** (like a microcontroller or microprocessor).
- Equipped with both **temporary memory (RAM)** and **permanent storage (ROM/Flash)**.
- Usually **part of a larger system**.
- **Customized** for a specific function (not for general-purpose computing).
- **Cost-effective** compared to general-purpose systems like PCs.

## ðŸ“± Example: Smartphone

A **smartphone** is a **complex device** that functions as a large system, containing **multiple embedded systems** inside.  
Each major component is often managed by its **own embedded system**.

## ðŸ”§ Embedded Systems Inside a Smartphone:

### 1. **Display System**
- Has its own **controller** (e.g., display driver IC).
- Manages **touch input** and **screen output**.
- May use its own **microcontroller and memory**.

### 2. **Mainboard (Motherboard)**
- Hosts the main **System on Chip (SoC)**, which includes:
  - **CPU**
  - **GPU**
  - **RAM**
  - Other core functions
- Acts as the **central embedded system** that controls the entire phone.

### 3. **Camera Module**
- Often includes its own **Image Signal Processor (ISP)**.
- Handles tasks like:
  - Autofocus
  - Exposure control
  - Image processing

### 4. **Gyroscope and Accelerometer (Sensors)**
- May include their own **dedicated processors**.
- Provide **real-time data** like:
  - Orientation
  - Motion
  - Acceleration
- Used in apps like **maps** and **games**.

### 5. **Wi-Fi / Bluetooth Module**
- Has its own **processor and firmware**.
- Manages **wireless communication protocols**.

### 6. **Fingerprint Sensor / Face ID System**
- Uses **specialized embedded processors**.
- Provides **fast and secure** biometric authentication.
