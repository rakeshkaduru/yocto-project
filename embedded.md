# What is an Embedded System?

An **embedded system** is a combination of **software and hardware** designed to perform a **specific function or task** within a larger system.

---

## üîë Key Characteristics:

- Contains a **processing unit** (like a microcontroller or microprocessor).
- Equipped with both **temporary memory (RAM)** and **permanent storage (ROM/Flash)**.
- Usually **part of a larger system**.
- **Customized** for a specific function (not for general-purpose computing).
- **Cost-effective** compared to general-purpose systems like PCs.

---

## üì± Example: Smartphone

A **smartphone** is a **complex device** that functions as a large system, containing **multiple embedded systems** inside.  
Each major component is often managed by its **own embedded system**.

---

## üîß Embedded Systems Inside a Smartphone:

### 1. **Display System**
- Has its own **controller** (e.g., display driver IC).
- Manages **touch input** and **screen output**.
- May use its own **microcontroller and memory**.

### 2. **Mainboard (Motherboard)**
- Hosts the main **System on Chip (SoC)**, which includes:
  - **CPU**
  - **GPU**
  - **RAM**
  - Other core functions
- Acts as the **central embedded system** that controls the entire phone.

### 3. **Camera Module**
- Often includes its own **Image Signal Processor (ISP)**.
- Handles tasks like:
  - Autofocus
  - Exposure control
  - Image processing

### 4. **Gyroscope and Accelerometer (Sensors)**
- May include their own **dedicated processors**.
- Provide **real-time data** like:
  - Orientation
  - Motion
  - Acceleration
- Used in apps like **maps** and **games**.

### 5. **Wi-Fi / Bluetooth Module**
- Has its own **processor and firmware**.
- Manages **wireless communication protocols**.

### 6. **Fingerprint Sensor / Face ID System**
- Uses **specialized embedded processors**.
- Provides **fast and secure** biometric authentication.

# üîß Embedded System from Hardware Perspective

## üß± 1. Starts from Sand
The journey begins with **sand**, which contains **silicon**.  
Silicon is **purified and processed** to create **transistors** ‚Äî the building blocks of all digital electronics.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è 2. Transistor Made of Silicon
A **transistor** is a tiny electronic switch.  
**Billions** of these are combined to make **integrated circuits (ICs)** or **chips**.  
Transistors are essential for **processing and storing data**.

---

## üß† 3. Layout Design
Engineers create a **layout design** of the chip using **software tools**.  
This design decides how **millions/billions of transistors** are connected and how **data flows**.

---

## üíæ 4. Chip Creation
The layout is used to **manufacture the chip** (e.g., **Rockchip RK3399**).  
This chip acts as the **brain of the embedded system** and includes:
- CPU
- GPU
- Memory controller
- Other processing units

---

## üîå 5. PCB Design (Printed Circuit Board)
The chip is placed onto a **PCB**, which connects all components together.  
PCB design includes:
- Tracks (wires)
- Power lines
- Connectors (e.g., USB, HDMI)

It ensures **communication** between chip, memory, sensors, and other parts.

---

## üñ•Ô∏è 6. Board Assembly
The final **embedded board** contains:
- The chip  
- **Memory** (RAM/Flash)  
- **Power circuits**  
- **Connectors** (USB, HDMI, etc.)

This board goes into an **embedded product** such as:
- Smartphone
- Washing machine
- Drone
- Smart camera
