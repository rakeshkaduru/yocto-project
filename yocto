 # What is Yocto?

Yocto provides **open source** components and **tools**  
to help developers create their own custom Linux distributions for **any hardware architecture**.


# What is a Custom Linux Distributions?


A **Custom Linux Distribution** is a Linux operating system that you build or modify yourself,  
including only the features, drivers, and components you need for your specific use case.


# 🔧 Why Build a Custom OS?

Because for **embedded systems** (like IoT, robots, or cars), you don’t need a full OS like Ubuntu. You need:

- ✅ **Smaller size**  
- 🚀 **Faster Performance**  
- 🧩 **Specific Drivers**  
- 🔒 **Better Security**  
- 🎛️ **Full Control**


🧱 Yocto Project Architecture (Overview)

This diagram gives a high-level overview of how the Yocto Project is used to build custom Linux system images for embedded systems 

⚙️ BitBake in Yocto Project

BitBake is the **build engine** at the heart of the **Yocto Project**.

---

## 🔧 What is BitBake?

- **BitBake** is a **task executor**.
- It **processes recipes** that tell it how to **fetch, configure, compile, install, and package** software.
- Think of it like **Make or CMake**, but designed for **building full Linux systems** — including:
  - Kernel
  - Bootloader
  - Libraries
  - Applications

---

## 📦 What Does “Processing Recipes” Mean?

> BitBake reads and executes **recipes** (`.bb` files), which contain step-by-step instructions for building software components.

### A recipe tells BitBake:
- Where to get the source code (Git, tarballs, etc.)
- How to apply patches
- How to configure the build for target hardware
- How to compile the code using the **toolchain**
- How to install the output
- How to package it into `.ipk`, `.rpm`, or `.deb`

---




### 1. 📄 Source Code

- You start with **source code** — this includes:
  - Kernel source
  - Drivers
  - Bootloader
  - Libraries
  - Applications
- This is written by the developer or pulled from open source.

---

### 2. ⚙ Build System (Yocto Build System)

This is the **heart of the process**, made up of:

#### a. Build Engine

- Core engine that runs the build.
- Uses **BitBake** (like `make`) to **process recipes** (instructions).
- A recipe tells BitBake **how to fetch, configure, compile, and package** software.

#### b. Toolchain (Compiler)

- Includes cross-compilers like GCC for ARM, RISC-V, etc.
- Converts source code into target binaries.

#### c. OpenEmbedded Layer

- Organizes build metadata (recipes, configs, classes).
- Layers make builds modular and reusable.

🧠 The Build System takes the source code and **compiles it using the toolchain** under control of **BitBake**.

---

### 3. 📁 Output Folder (Binaries)

- Compiled binaries are stored here.
- Includes:
  - Kernel image
  - Bootloader
  - Root filesystem
  - Libraries, tools

---

### 4. 🖼️ System Image(s)

- System image is generated from the output binaries.
- Example: `.img`, `.bin`, `.elf`
- Can be written to:
  - SD card
  - eMMC
  - Flashed directly to device

---

### 5. 💻 Target Hardware (Embedded Board)

- The physical embedded device.
- Example: Raspberry Pi, Rockchip, custom SoC boards.
- The image is **deployed** to the board to **run**.

---

### 6. 🧪 Terminal Output (Debugging)

- Logs from the build system.
- Serial/SSH output from the device during runtime.
- Useful for **monitoring and debugging**.

---

## 🔄 Flow Summary

1. Write or gather source code.  
2. Use Yocto's build system (**BitBake + OpenEmbedded + Toolchain**) to compile it.  
3. Get output binaries.  
4. Generate a **custom Linux system image**.  
5. Load it onto embedded hardware.  
6. Test/debug via the terminal/console.

---

✅ Result: A lightweight, efficient, and customized Linux OS image ready to run on your embedded device.


# 🔄 Flow Diagram Explanation: Yocto Project

## 🔵 1. Arch Linux (Host OS)

This is your **host development environment**.

You use a Linux distro like **Arch Linux**, **Ubuntu**, or any other to **run the Yocto build system**.

> ⚠️ **Note:** Yocto does **not replace** the host OS — it **runs on top of it**.

---

## 🔴 2. Poky (Build Toolchain & Metadata)

**Poky** is the **reference distribution** of the **Yocto Project**.  
It provides the **core components** needed to build your own **custom embedded Linux system**.

📌 Think of **Poky** as the **“starter kit”** or **foundation** provided by Yocto.

### 🔧 Poky Contains 3 Key Parts:

| Part                       | Description                                                                          |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🧠 **BitBake**             | The **build engine**. It executes tasks (like fetch, compile, install).              |
| 📂 **Metadata**            | Recipes (`.bb` files), classes, and layers to describe how to build software.        |
| 🧰 **Reference Configuration** | A sample working configuration and distro (for learning or starting point).     |

> ✅ **Poky = BitBake (engine) + Metadata (blueprints) + Sample Distro (Poky config)**  
> Poky is the **backbone** of any Yocto build system and the **starting point** for creating a custom Linux OS.

---

## ⚫ 3. Your Own Distro

After running Poky with your configuration, you generate:

- A **custom embedded Linux distribution**
- Tailored for your **target hardware** (like Raspberry Pi, NXP board, etc.)
- Includes **only required packages** → Lightweight & optimized

### 🎯 Example Output:
- 🧩 **Kernel image**
- 📦 **Root filesystem**
- 🔧 **Bootloader**
- 🛠️ **SDK**

---

> ✅ This is how you go from a **general-purpose Host OS**, through **Poky**, to your own **target-specific embedded OS**.



# 📌 Explanation of Diagram: Tasks in Embedded Systems (Yocto/BitBake Flow)

This diagram shows the **build steps** performed by **BitBake** when it processes a recipe (`.bb` file) in the **Yocto Project** for building software packages in embedded systems.

---

## 🧱 Step-by-Step Task Flow:

| Step             | Description                                                                 |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1. Fetch**     | BitBake **downloads the source code** (from Git, HTTP, mirrors, etc.).     |
| **2. Decompress**| The downloaded archive (e.g., `.tar.gz`) is **extracted/unpacked**.         |
| **3. Patch**     | Any **patches specified in the recipe** are applied to the source code.     |
| **4. Configure** | The build system is configured for **target hardware/platform**.            |
| **5. Compile**   | The source is **compiled** using compilers (e.g., GCC) to create binaries.  |
| **6. Install**   | The compiled binaries are **installed** into a temporary staging area.      |
| **7. Package**   | The output is packaged into **deployable formats** like `.rpm`, `.deb`, `.ipk`. |
| **8. QA**        | (Optional) **Quality checks/tests** are run to validate the build.          |

---

## 🔁 Red Arrows in the Diagram

- Show **fallbacks or re-runs**.
- Example: If configuration fails after compilation starts, it loops back to **Configure**.

---

## ✅ Final Result (Output)

- Successfully built and tested software **packaged** for embedded Linux systems.
- Output formats include: `.rpm`, `.ipk`, `.deb`
- These can be used for:
  - Installing onto embedded devices
  - Image generation in Yocto
  - Application development

---

## 🧠 Simple Summary

> BitBake processes a recipe by performing a **series of tasks** — from **downloading source code** to **packaging it** — so it can be used in custom Linux systems for embedded hardware.
